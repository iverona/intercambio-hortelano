## Brief overview
This document outlines my development workflow preferences.

## Framework
- This app uses shadcn. Whenever possible, use components from the framework and don't ask to install others. Remember that shadcn-ui is deprecated. 

## Development server
- Do not run the `npm run dev` command after each task. I will have it running in a separate tab.

## Browser
- Do not ask to open a browser to verify changes. I will check the changes myself.
